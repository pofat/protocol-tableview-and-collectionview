# Pushing The Limits of Protocol-Oriented Programming

This repo is inspired by [Jesse Squires](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires)'s presentation at [Swift Summit](https://www.swiftsummit.com/).

There are five desiring goals in this repos:

1. protocol-based
2. type-safe
3. **unify** UITableView and UICollectionView
4. remove UIKit boilerplate
5. avoid *NSObject* and *NSObjectProtocol*, in order to be purely Swifty



To understand the power and benefits of POP, I try to implement it by myself and this is it.
